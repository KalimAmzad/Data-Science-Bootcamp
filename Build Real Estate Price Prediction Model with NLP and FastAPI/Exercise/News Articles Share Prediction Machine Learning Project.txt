News Articles Share Prediction Machine Learning Project


Problem Statement
Predicting the popularity of news articles is an important task in the 
field of journalism and online media. By accurately predicting the number 
of shares an article is likely to receive, media companies can optimize 
their content distribution strategies and reach a wider audience.

 

There are several approaches to predicting the popularity of news 
articles, including machine learning algorithms, natural language 
processing techniques, and statistical analysis.

 

One common approach is to use machine learning algorithms, such as 
regression or decision trees, to analyze features of the articles, such as 
the headline, the length of the article, the author, and the topics 
covered, to predict the number of shares. The algorithms can be trained on 
a dataset of articles and their corresponding share counts to learn 
patterns in the data.

average_token_length: Average length of the words in the content

num_keywords: number of keywords in metadata

data_channel: data channel of the article

min_avg_key: minimum shares for average keywords

max_avg_key: maximum shares for average keywords

avg_avg_key: average shares for average keywords
